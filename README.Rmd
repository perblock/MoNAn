# MoNAn

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

MoNAn is the software implementation of the statistical model outlined in:

Block, P., Stadtfeld, C., & Robins, G. (2022). A statistical model for the analysis of mobility 
tables as weighted networks with an application to faculty hiring networks. Social Networks, 68, 264-278.

as found [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378873321000654).

## Installation

The package is still under development. 
You can install the development version of MoNAn from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("perblock/MoNAn")
```

or using:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("perblock/MoNAn")
```


## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(MoNAn)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
