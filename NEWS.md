The following functions are used differently:

- gofMobilityNetwork does not require the specification of simulations anymore!

Further changes:

The results objects are much smaller and contain less redundant information.

# MoNAn 0.3.0

New functions to specify the model: createEffects and addEffect
New function to generate the process state: monanDataCreate

Creation of alias: monanAlgorithmCreate for createAlgorithm
Creation of alias: monan07 for estimateMobilityNetwork

Implementation of new effects

Implementation of paralellization in Phase 1 of the estimation.

# MoNAn 0.1.3

Various bugfixes and improvements.
