\description{
Is there a bandwagon effect in mobility, i.e. do mobile individuals move to locations
that are the destination of many others from their origin? The functional form of this
statistic assumes that individuals consider the proportions of individuals (coming from
the same origin) going to a certain destination, instead of the total number.
This is weighted by an attribute of the origin, to model differences in
concentration by origin characteristic.
